# ecommerce branch

This branch contains all the code for the client-side/front-end portion of the website.

The homepage showcases product sales to catch the user's attention right away. Products are dynamically fetched from the backend API to ensure the latest items are always displayed. 

Users can browse products conveniently using different categories and filters, and select each product to view a dedicated page providing detailed information about the item. Users may add the product to their cart in their chosen quantity and continue browsing, or view their cart and examine the cost breakdown.
